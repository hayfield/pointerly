Pointerly
=========

A framework for testing things using pointers.

### How to best obtain and collect data

* Use a [browser that includes high resolution timing](http://caniuse.com/#search=navigation%20timing)
* Use a [browser with FileSystem support](http://caniuse.com/#search=filesystem) to store data

If running Pointerly in Chrome using the local file system (the URL starts with `file:`), set the `--allow-file-access-from-files` flag for access to the FileSystem.
